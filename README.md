# Project Description
Android app (Worth It App) that stores item costs and compares their relative value.

I often find myself wondering if something I want to buy is worth it, and while trying to decide I tend to think in terms of other items I already consider worth their value. 

"Is this $30 ticket to a concert worth it? Well, it's worth about 3 meals at my favorite restaurant, so that seems alright to me."

This app will store user entered data and display it to compare item worth.


# Getting Started 
To run the app locally through Android Studio, download the repo and import the project into Android Studio. Clean/Rebuild, then run the project through a simulator or device. 

# How it works
User can add items and their cost that they consider "worth" the value. These items are saved (written to a file) and can be viewed in the Item List page. You can also delete items one by one or all at once.

Once some items that are deemed "Worth It" are added, you can enter an item and its cost whose value you wish to compare with your existing items, and tap the "Worth It?" button on the main page. The app will display the approximate worth of the new item using previously added items in a dynamically created list on the page.

Written in Java and XML, uses standard Java and Android libraries. 

# Future Plans
- Improve UI and add colors. 
- Dynamically find relevent item information/prices from the web to show in the comparison/worth lists.
- Option to rewrite duplicate item entries
