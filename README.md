# WorthItApp
Android app that stores item cost and compares relative value

Add Items (with their cost) that you consider "worth" the value (These items are saved and can be viewed in the Item List page)

Once some "worth it" items are added, enter an item and it's cost whose value you wish to compare with your existing items, and
the app will display the approximate worth of the new item using previously added items.
